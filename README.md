# megrpg2.0 

- An HTML ONLY game I wrote for a chick about 8 years ago.  I didn't know javascript at the time so HTML was it.  Wrote this while being snowed in for a couple of days with no internet and no way to leave my house out in the middle butt hole Iowa.  This same thing also helped launch my career in cloud computing and automation... curious right?  Showed the part where megan as a strips her clothes off at the sight of water and yells "WATERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!" during my interview. ;)

- This is for lolz, memories and smiles.  Nothing more.
