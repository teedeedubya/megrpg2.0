<ul>
<li>Megan has explored the world, conquered all that she saw, destoryed everything
<li>evil , and made love to her beloved snuggle bunny...many times...many....whew..
<li>However, something horrible happened on one fateful night that would disrupt
<li>Megan's life forever(or at least for a while).  While Megan was asleep with her
<li>dearest snuggle bunny, something horrible happened.  Something almost as bad
<li>as throwing away two perfectly good mc.chicken sandwidches.  A short, weak, crippled
<li>elf snuck into megan's love nest and stole her beloved snuggle bunny away.  Snuggle
<li>bunny attempted to fend off the impressivly strong enemy but failed....badly.
<li>Snuggle bunny still claims that the elf was really strong however other witnesses
<li>say that the elf looked pretty weak....A lot of witnesses said that....anyhoo
<li>megan woke up from the girly screams coming from her beloved snuggle bunny as he
<li>was being stolen away.  Megan arose with a amazon like yell and said" Let go
<li>of my snuggle bunny.  However, she couldn't keep up with the crippled, weak, short
<li>elf. However, she followed the little bastards trail for many days.  That was untill
<li>the trail faded away(actually she just got tired and decided to go to sleep).  But
<li>during her slumber, creatures came out of the nearby grassy plains and bit her with
<li>their venomous catamine laced teeth and darkness took her.  She strayed out of 
<li>thought and time.stars wheeled overhead...and every moment she was asleep was as 
<li>long as a life age of the earth.  But it was not the end. She felt life in her
<li>again (tony clicks off lord of the rings two...).  Megan got up in an unknown area.
<li>It had become obvious to megan on what had happened.  The creatures dragged her 
<li>somewhere else because they couldn't knaw through her impenitrable amazon silky/
<li>rock hard skin.  However, this didn't detur megan from her quest of trying to save
<li>beloved snuggle bunny.
