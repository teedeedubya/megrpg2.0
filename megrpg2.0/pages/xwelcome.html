<p>meg rpg 2.0 was made strickly with notepad and mspaint.  It was programmed in mostly html.</p></center>
<br>
<br><center><h1>instructions</h1><br>
because i'm so cool, i thought i might throw in a <br>few instructions on how to play the game... it<br> shouldn't be too hard to understand, but <br>some people might not get the set up at first., so <br>with that being said.  Here the instructions.<br>
<ul>
<li>read the storyline and stuff....
<li>click on the map around your charicter to explore the world.
<li>remeber to scroll down if there's a scroll bar... approximatly 100% of the time there's something down there.
<li>if you think your about to quit, remember the save code
<li>have fun
</ul><br>
